A platform for searchable, direct access to and scrutiny of Portuguese Parliament transcripts

Transcripts from the Portuguese Parliamentary proceedings are available from 1975 on only in .pdf format. It's impossible to search them by any other 's factor than date. The role of the media in democracy is to scrutinize the government in the best interested of the people. To facilitate the process of Scrutinizing Parliamentary Discourse, I made a searchable, interlinked, digital transcript of the Portuguese Parliament.

DISCLAIMER: Code, Dataset API, and public website coming soon.
